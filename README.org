* rpm-git-tree

Tooling for developing RPM packages from a release branch.

My git repositories contain branches for each relevant release, based on
upstream's git tag for the appropriate release, like
[[https://github.com/frozencemetery/krb5/tree/rawhide][my Fedora krb5 tree]].
I then use make_patches.py (which calls into spec_parse.py) to produce
dist-git trees, like [[https://github.com/frozencemetery/krb5_fedora][the
Fedora krb5 dist-git]].  Finally, these are built in a Fedora chroot
(controlled using enter_fedora.sh).

More features as annoyance warrants.  Pull requests welcome, but I probably
won't take anything complicated that I don't myself use.

** cleanup_mail.py

Pulls out mail from a mailto: link on a webpage.

** make_patches.py

From a git repository, generate the patches section(s) of a spec file.

** enter_fedora.sh

Wrangler script for entering and exiting a (Fedora) chroot.
