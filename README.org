* rpm-git-tree

Tooling for developing RPM packages from a release branch

Essentially, I've a branch in my local fork that's based off upstream's git
tag for the appropriate release.  Then I can use all the version control
tooling (rebase especially) to carry distro changes.

More features as annoyance warrants.  Pull requests welcome; Rust is
preferred, but shell is okay for simple things, and Python is okay too.
