* rpm-git-tree

Tooling for developing RPM packages from an external git tree

Basically, I like the way Debian packages are handled.  This brings me closer
to that, while adding more git integration.

Essentially, I've got a branch in my local fork that's based off upstream's
git tag for the appropriate release.  Then I can use all the git tooling
(rebase especially) to carry distro changes.

More features as annoyance warrants.  Pull requests welcome; please limit
languages to Python and Rust (e.g., no shell scripts).
